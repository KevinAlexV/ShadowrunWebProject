					<h3 class="parallelogram twentyper">Ragusa.</h3>
					<p class="characterdesc">I originated from one of those mega corporations. It's been too long, I don't even remember the name. They we're once a decent company,
						always putting the customers first. They actually put love and care into what they made. But cash changes that, doesn't it? Cash gives you power. 
						Power generates a lust to become a part of the top level freaks. Y'know, the ones that can control whatever the hell they want. I left before they
						locked everyone else in. I guess I escaped just in time. It's been a while since then, I don't even know what happened to my parents.
						I can only assume that they had to stay. Admittedly, they didn't have much time for me. I was always raised by some fashion of tech.
						I suppose that's why I learned how to tamper with the Matrix. I started tampering with my robotic caretakers, and went from there.
						It only took that much more time to get my own devices to mess with my surroundings. It's been a while since then. I went to the streets to
						make a living on my own. As a <b>Shadowrunner</b>. That's when I learned what they call people who carry my skills: A <b>Decker</b>. So, that's what I am.
						A <b>Decker.</b> I am <b>Ragusa, the Decker</b>

					<h3 class="parallelogram twentyper">Ragusa, the Decker</h3>
					<p class="characterdesc">
						There’s no such thing as an unhackable
						system—only one that hasn’t been hacked
						yet. The Decker sees every system as a challenge,
						every encrypted file as an invitation
						to pit their skills, programs and customized
						cyberdeck against whatever the Matrix has
						to offer. Everything from remote cameras to
						data files to the cyberware and weapons of
						their foes are subject to their whim, as long as
						they’re connected to the Matrix—and what
						isn’t these days? The Decker uses state of-the-art,
						personally customized hardware
						and software to manipulate the electronic
						world and augmented reality, and when
						things heat up, they can immerse themselves fully
						into virtual reality, moving at the speed of
						thought through the system and smoothing
						the way for their meat-bound teammates.
						“Stuck in a basement? No chance—I’m
						large and in charge, gathering intel and
						solving problems for my team, in the line of
						fire, risking my life to keep ALL of us safe.”
