					<p class="characterdesc"> I wasn't always within a city. I lived outside of it, when everything wasn't super industrialized. It was quite the peaceful life. 
						I even remember when the awakening occurred. I remember joining a magic club filled with Elfs. At first, they wanted to kick me out due to my lack in magical abilities,
						but my persistence caused them to give up trying. Given time, I learned that I had magical abilities. I was one of the first humans to have such abilities I guess. 
						From there, I trained up my skills under their guidance. We wanted to put our skills to the test, so we went to some local city and took on a job, 
						posing as a <b>Shadowrunner</b>. It was a huge mistake. None of us were prepared for the combat these jobs ensue. I counted 17 heads when we went 
						into the city. Coming out, I counted 3. I was one of them. I had lost a lot of people I deemed dear to me. I never wanted to see the city again. 
						The city alone shot me back in time to re-experience those memories. Running away only made it worst, as those mega corps. expanded across the land, 
						consuming my home town with it. There was no-where left to run. I wanted to get past this whole thing, and make my friends proud of what they created. 
						So I faced the city head-on, and took on the challenge of becoming a <b>Shadowrunner</b>. It's been some time. When you work in this business for this 
						long, you kind of lose track of time. Time becomes a measurement of how long before your next paycheck. With my magical abilities, I think I've managed 
						to give myself some more time. They call me a combat mage. So if you ever hear of <b>Dakota, the Combat Mage</b>, that would probably be me.

					<p class="characterdesc">
						Magic has a lot of uses, from sneaking into places to manipulating
						people’s minds to healing and strengthening
						other members of his team. But there’s always magic that
						just blasts suckers in the face. This is the combat mage’s
						strength. He’s large, rough, and not subtle in the least, and
						he leaves scorched marks and bruised bodies in his wake.
						He’s the reason opponents want to “geek the mage first,”
						but it’s going to take a lot more than a street proverb to
						bring him down.
